Recursion exercises

Jasmine tests are NOT yet implemented, so please do not use the tests. Just use console.log to check if your functions are correct.

This repository has some fundamental practice problems for recursion.

They include:
<li> Binary Search
<li> FizzBuzz (recursive)
<li> Palindrome
<li> Pattern Counting
<li> Tree Maker
<li> Tree Searcher

Answers for each are located in the individual files in the base folder. <b>Please use the src/recursion.js for the exercises and refer to the named files in the base folder for sample answers.</b>
